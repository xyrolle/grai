# Measured

The README's charts come from benches anyone can run, on `bench/synthetic.mjs`'s catalog: `pnpm readme` in `bench/` runs them in one window and writes `bench/results/`, and `node scripts/charts.ts` draws the charts and their tables from those files. Each file holds the date, the machine, the load and the libraries' versions it was measured with.

| Chart | Bench | Results |
|---|---|---|
| What a page downloads | `hydrate` | `hydrate-synthetic.json` |
| A message call on a server | `server` | `server-synthetic.json` |
| Time i18n adds to a production build | `build-added`, at 6,366 and 13,326 keys | `build-added.json` |
| An edit in development | `hmr` | `hmr-synthetic.json` |
| Next.js in development | `nextjs` | `nextjs-synthetic.json` |
| The refactoring commands | `refactor` | `refactor-synthetic.json` |
| The runtime's size | `library-bytes` | `library-bytes-synthetic.json` |

The numbers below come from the catalogs of two real apps, compared with Paraglide 2.29.1:
- app A (SvelteKit, 6,379 keys × 3);
- app B (13,326 keys × 3).

They were taken on an M-series Mac; `docs/runtime.md` explains how to run the benches.

| | app A, Paraglide → grai | app B, Paraglide → grai | Reproduced by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full compile | 51 s → 0.15 s | 20.9 s → 0.25 s | `bench/compile-time.mjs` |
| Compile with nothing changed | 44.6 s → 0.06 s | | `bench/compile-time.mjs` |
| One message edited, compiled | | 20.9 s → 0.20 s | `bench/compile-time.mjs` |
| Dev server, cold start | 85 s → 8 s | | the app's own `vite dev` |
| One message edited, until the page shows it | 41.6 s → 0.9 s | | the app's own `vite dev` |

App A's Paraglide compile includes the TypeScript declarations that its `sync` writes; app B's does not.

At runtime, on app A's catalogs, compared with Paraglide, i18next 26.4 and use-intl 4.14. grai's rows run its own output: on the server as its Vite plugin builds it, and in a page as its client build ships it, with the page's locale copies. Paraglide's call in a page runs its strategy each time; given `{ locale }`, it takes the second figure:

| | grai | Paraglide | i18next | use-intl | `bench/` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A text message on the server | 19–25 ns | 46–50 ns | 1.4–1.8 µs | 2.7–3.2 µs | `server` |
| A text message in a page | 4.4–4.8 ns | 361–394 ns; 4.5–5.9 ns | 1.0–1.1 µs | 1.3–1.5 µs | `client` |
| A message with inputs in a page | 18–19 ns | 366–392 ns; 11.7–12.3 ns | 2.1–2.2 µs | 1.4–1.5 µs | `client` |
| Server render of 2,000 messages | 0.13 ms | 0.20–0.23 ms | 3.9 ms | 4.8–5.0 ms | `ssr` |
| Hydrating that page | 5.4–6.9 ms | 7.9–10.4 ms | 12.2–15.6 ms | 16.7–21.6 ms | `hydrate` |
| That page's JS, brotli | 22.9–24.9 KB | 38.0–40.5 KB | 125–133 KB | 125–133 KB | `hydrate` |
| The runtime in the browser, its whole API, brotli | 1.0 KB | 3.6 KB | 12.1 KB | 10.2 KB | `library-bytes` |
| A new server process: load, then first render | 16.6 + 3.1 ms | 46.6 + 2.3 ms | 14.5 + 11.2 ms | 13.0 + 21.9 ms | `startup` |
| Type checking 500 calls with `tsc` 7 | 82 ms | 278 ms | 609 ms | 521 ms | `types` |
| The editor's first completion of a key | 0.2 s | 1.0 s | 49 s | 21 s | `types` |
